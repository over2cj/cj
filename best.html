progressive-inspired thrash played with such revolting accuracy is makes me wonder for their sanity. genuinely just good-sounding music. definitely my favorite by them, and they struck that late 80's / early 90's sound while the iron was hot. this album is timeless. it quickly became a favorite. don't believe that it's any good? listen and prove yourself wrong.

i was really pleasantly surprised by this album. what fully hooked me was it ending with inside your world, which capped the entire thing off perfectly. it's like hardrock goes u2. something about it is so hopeless and needful. i'm such a glutton for this sort of stuff.

confession: i'm not the van halen guy, someone close to me is, but i finally gave this album a front to back and was mega floored. go and listen to this album at least 23 hours a day. if music's the food of love then love sounds like eddie van halen. i know i'm a philistine having not played it straight through sooner, but i was satisfied with the few songs off i thatt i knew. no. this is a masterpiece in full. don't try and bust my chops saying they're overrated. my chops cannot be busted.

i was actually recommended this band via a great friend, and i had to say something about this album because it stuck out to me. not sure if this is still screamo or melancholic pop punk, but whatever it is, it's killer. it made johnny my favorite lead by far. i think it has some of their best music on it. i've listened to it a few times now, and i keep thinking to myself *yes*. this is exactly how this genre of music should be. hey, you listen to this album and see how you feel. robot with human hair, purple reign, blue dream, this just sounds so damn good for what it is. and thank you for showing me this, you know who you are. </div>

just amazing and agreeable heavy metal. they're really a flawless band, and to me this album was their peak. divinity and chains of humanity blew my mind. i can't even tell you how many little playlists this album has inspired. if played loud enough, this will at least scare immediate neighbors. i think this album is extra apt lately, as a political concept.
