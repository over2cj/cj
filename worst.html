enough. with. american pie. if you've ever seen a group of people on any remotely patriotic day of the year, you've been assaulted with this crap. 'the day the music died' is the day that a few major artists-- specifically buddy holly, that one tv personality, and the teen that wrote la bamba-- all went down in a snowy, midwestern plane crash back in 1959. so, right, american pie's good for a minute or two, you're like hey this is actually catchy, not too bad... but it gets excessive eventually, and then it carries on for another four minutes after your ears had started to strain. american pie's lyrics are chalk-filled-up with 50's-end nostalgia bites, and you can tell don's trying to be artsy and tragic as he explains that the world's only getting more and more demonic, and he struggles to atone for his bad attitude with wet hippie sincerity, and he's forced to make the song an hour long to doubly insult the public. all while buddy holly spins in his grave. and, hey, the radio always plays the full eight-point-five minute record each and every time, what's with that?!

i knew one of those guys who're super into lil peep circa 2021, and he convinced me to stay up and do a listening party with him of this album when it dropped since none of his other friends were willing or nocturnal enough. suffice to say... i was down a friend after 'suffer on.' i think we should send this genre of person to war so they get shot instead of real people.

whatever. i know people might dislike me hating his music. to that, all i have to say is: so what? get better taste, quickly. give this corny music stuff a rest already. he's never written a good song and he never will. ever. not because it's impossible, just it's impossible for him. i'm sure someone out there has at least one decent reason to like his stuff. i'm sure i haven't given it an utterly fair chance, given he's one of MANY artists i block on spotify. maybe i sound like a dinosaur hating on mainstream music. but at least i'm not being fooled into believing i'm hearing art with this stuff.

okay, look, i know a lot of you losers connect to this song spiritually, and if you're the type to wallow in how different you are(n't), don't let me stop you. i guess it's okay for karaoke. maybe i hate this song not because it's whiny suckdown nonsense, but because the pretentious tool thom yorke thinks he's the utmost of musical art when in reality he's terrible. radiohead instrumental's aren't ever bad, and they have some good lyrics, but they're screwed up by the inevitable intrusion of their moron lead. he just sounds like a moron. you can hear it in his voice.

i really can't listen to this sort of stuff. for every hippie song i raise you one steely dan's 'only a fool would say that.' steely dan makes some good points. these people sounded so damn stupid sometimes. i get grateful dead are legends. really, i do. i was named after a grateful dead song. my mom has the stupid little bear sticker on the back of her car. i had to go see a grateful dead reenactment band with her over in south carolina this one time, and she played this band the whole way there. and back. they have too many songs. they are not good enough to have made that many mediocre songs. if your discography is constitution-length at least write like your life depends on it. not the same lazy bs most of their songs sound like. but hey, who knows? compared to the music that comes out today, something like this being made again now might really take off. idiots.

i used to like her fame stuff as a kid. and sure, maybe she's a backwards sellout now, but some of that older stuff remains good today. this song needs to be unwritten, however. i just don't care about her music in this genre, this song is actively disliked by me. gaga. please. make an effort. but hey, a copy of this album would make good target practice.

OH MY GODDDDDDDD. WHAT???? i was innocently listening to an old seventies mix when this song came on and made me want to drop what i was doing and find a shotgun to decorate my chin. listening to this creep singing about having a baby while some sort of young child takes the high harmony and a little xylophone accompanies the verses about following him to where the 'children play...' i just can't. look, again with the probably wet hippie sincerity thing, i doubt he thought it through enough, but he maybe probably definitely should've.

wait, again with the baby garbage? two steps to understanding my hatred: 1. be a woman 2. listen to this song. seriously, try not to get creeped out. isn't this the same guy dating someone fifty years younger? i needed to bleach my eyes after watching them on that one ball drop a couple years back. even worse some girl is on this track endorsing it and talking about how she's a woman in love right after he sings the stellar line, 'whoa, the seed inside ya, baby, do you feel it growin'?' ... ugh, just no. screw this. what tf is wrong with people??
